## Description

This application is to help view and interact with information stored in databases. The application is a Content Management System (CMS)
which presents the user/client with a series of prompts to view, manage business departments, assign roles, & add or edit employees.

The application uses the MySQL2 package to connect to a MySQL database & perform queries, and uses Inquirer package to prompt the user. The
console.table package was included to print MySQL rows to the console.
